Blockchain-Based Drug Traceability System
This repository contains a blockchain-based system designed to enhance the traceability of pharmaceutical products. Traditional paper-based systems are vulnerable to errors, fraud, and counterfeiting, posing serious health risks and financial losses. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project aims to provide a decentralized and tamper-proof solution to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the drug supply chain.

Key Features

Decentralized and Tamper-Proof:
Utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure and immutable ledger for drug traceability.
Eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing the risk of errors and fraud.

Comprehensive Traceability:
Monitors the movement of drugs from manufacturing to dispensing.
Provides a transparent and accountable record of transactions accessible to authorized stakeholders.

Regulatory Compliance:
Meets global regulatory requirements, such as the U.S. DSCSA and China's drug traceability mandates.
Ensures that all stakeholders comply with regulations, thereby reducing the incidence of counterfeit drugs.

Privacy and Security:
Protects sensitive traceability data, including statistical information related to drug productivity and sales.
Incorporates robust user authentication and access control mechanisms to safeguard information.

Enhanced Accountability:
Assigns responsibility for drug security to relevant stakeholders.
Facilitates government regulation by providing reliable information about the drug supply chain.

Benefits

Improved Safety and Effectiveness:
Ensures that pharmaceutical products are genuine and safe for consumption.
Enhances the overall integrity of the drug supply chain.

Transparency and Accountability:
Provides stakeholders and patients with convenient access to drug movement information.
Enhances accountability across the supply chain.

Reduced Counterfeiting:
Significantly lowers the risk of counterfeit drugs entering the supply chain.
Ensures that patients receive legitimate medications.
